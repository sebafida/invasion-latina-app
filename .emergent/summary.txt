The user's primary goal is to finalize their Invasion Latina mobile app for release. This involves completing a full internationalization (i18n) for four languages (French, English, Spanish, Dutch), fixing all remaining UI text issues, and successfully deploying a feature-complete version to TestFlight for beta testing, ultimately leading to an App Store release.

During the session, the user's requests evolved:
- Initially, the main task was to finish the i18n implementation that was already in progress.
- The user discovered a critical bug where the profile page crashed due to an i18n implementation error ().
- The user requested that language selection be available on the very first screen when the app opens, and also on the login page.
- Through multiple rounds of feedback with screenshots, the user pointed out numerous hardcoded (untranslated) text strings in various parts of the app, including titles, buttons, alert messages, and descriptive text.
- The user requested a specific UI change on the home page: the Spotify section's subtitle should always be Que viva la m√∫sica latina, and a duplicate Social Networks section should be removed.
- A new backend requirement was added: create a non-admin user account specifically for Apple's review process with the credentials  / .

**User's preferred language**: French (fr). The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application's i18n implementation is now nearly complete and robust. The agent fixed a critical crash by refactoring the  to provide a translation function  and updated the entire codebase to use this new, consistent syntax. Language selection modals are now present on both the initial welcome screen () and the login screen ().

The agent has gone through multiple iterative cycles of finding and replacing hardcoded text based on user feedback, covering most pages, modals, and alerts.

A backend user account for the Apple reviewer has been successfully created and its login functionality verified via .

The critical issue from the previous fork‚Äîthe TestFlight build being out of sync‚Äîhas not been addressed in this session and remains a major blocker for the project's final goal. The code on the development server is significantly more advanced than what is on the user's local machine for building.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was in the process of translating the final two pages pointed out by the user: Galeries Photos () and Aftermovies (). The agent had just located the files and viewed their contents to identify the hardcoded text.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? After applying the translations, the user must perform manual testing in Expo Go by switching languages and navigating to these pages.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Finalize translations for  and . (P0, HIGHEST)
- Issue 2: TestFlight build is completely out of sync with the development environment, making it unusable for testing. (P1)
- Issue 3: The user's request from a previous session for a back arrow in the Request tab is still unresolved and needs explicit confirmation. (P2)

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1: Finalize translations for  and .**
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent successfully located the files (, ) and was about to add the necessary translation keys and apply them.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Add new translation keys to  for all hardcoded text in  and .
        2.  Provide the translations for all four languages (FR, EN, ES, NL).
        3.  Use  to replace the hardcoded strings in both files with the  function.
        4.  Perform one final  across the entire  directory for any other common French/English words to ensure nothing was missed.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will complete the user's request for a fully translated application, which is a prerequisite for the TestFlight submission.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y (The overall missed translation issue has been recurring throughout the session).
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: User will test the frontend manually in Expo Go.
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

- **Issue 2: TestFlight build is out of sync and unusable.**
    - **Attempted fixes**: This was not worked on in the current session. Previous fixes involved updating  and , but the core problem is that these changes are not on the user's local machine used for building. The previously identified solution (HEAD is now at 89388601 auto-commit for 58e8b8b2-b0bc-44f0-8587-b65729e00e0d) has not been executed yet.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Once all translation work is confirmed complete by the user, this becomes the highest priority task.
        2.  Guide the user to run  to force-sync their local files.
        3.  Verify the sync by asking the user to ê¯@@–√9@8

    - **Where to resume**: The agent needs to add translation keys for  and  to  and then apply them to the respective files.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully multilingual application, fulfilling the user's primary request for this session.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: User will test via Expo Go.
    - **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0: Final User Verification of Translations**: After fixing , ask the user to perform a full review of the app in Expo Go to confirm all text is translated correctly.
    - **P1: Final TestFlight Build & Submission**: Guide the user through a successful build and submission to TestFlight. This is the most critical step after i18n is done.
    - **P2: Submit to the main App Store**: Once the user approves the TestFlight version.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - Generate Android Beta Build.
    - Comprehensive Web Admin Dashboard.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full i18n Implementation & Refactor (MAJOR)**:
    - **Crash Fix**: Repaired a critical app crash on the profile page by refactoring  to provide  as a function instead of an object.
    - **Code Refactoring**: Updated the entire existing codebase (, , , , , etc.) to use the consistent  syntax.
    - **Comprehensive Translation**: Iteratively added dozens of new translation keys and applied them to nearly every file in the app, including , , , , , , , , and .
    - **Dynamic Text Translation**: Translated text inside  calls and custom modals.
- **Feature: Language Selection on App Start**:
    - Implemented a language selection modal on the initial welcome screen ().
    - Implemented a language selection modal on the login screen ().
- **Backend: Apple Reviewer Account Creation**:
    - Created a Python script to add a user directly to the MongoDB database.
    - Debugged and resolved multiple issues during creation: invalid email format, missing , and an incorrect database field name ( vs. ).
    - Successfully created and verified the login for the user .
- **UI/UX Polish**:
    - As requested, modified the home page to remove a duplicate Follow Us section and ensure the R√©seaux Sociaux title is translated.
    - Modified the  translation key to have the static value Que viva la m√∫sica latina for all languages.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Unclear Request Tab Navigation**
    -   **Debug checklist**: Ask the user for clarification or confirmation that the global header fixed their concern.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: To fully address all of the user's UI feedback.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Frontend.
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None in this session, but the *risk* of the TestFlight sync issue from the previous fork remains high.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **i18n Refactoring**: Migrating an entire application's translation access pattern from object property access () to a function call () to fix a critical runtime error and improve consistency. This involved changing the React Context provider and updating all consumer components.
-   **Iterative Translation**: A development process driven by tight user feedback loops, where translation gaps are identified via screenshots, fixed, and re-verified.
-   **Direct Database Manipulation**: Using a one-off Python script with  and  to securely create a new user in the MongoDB database from the command line, bypassing the standard registration flow.
-   **Backend Login Debugging**: Using  to test a login endpoint and analyzing  responses by checking backend logs to identify and fix a .

**key DB schema**
- No schema changes.
- A new document was added to the  collection with the following important fields: , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes to the tech stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : **Central file for this session.** Massively updated and contains all UI text.
-   : **Crucial.** Contains the fix for the app-breaking crash.
-   : **Next to be edited.** Contains hardcoded text.
-   : **Next to be edited.** Contains hardcoded text.
-   : Contains the new language selector on the welcome screen.
-   : Contains the new language selector on the login screen.
-   : Was heavily modified for UI cleanup and translation.
-   : The login endpoint () was debugged against.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your immediate first task is to finish the translations for  and .** The user is very thorough and will spot any remaining hardcoded text.
-   After translating those two files, do a final  for common French words (, , , , ) in the  files to catch anything missed.
-   Once the user confirms ALL translations are perfect in Expo Go, your **most important task** is to guide them to create a new TestFlight build. You must re-address the sync issue. The proven method is: Save to GitHub, then guide the user on their machine to run , increment  in , and then run An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username. Be patient and explicit.
-   The Apple reviewer account is  with password . The user will need this for their TestFlight submission.

**documents created in this job**
- None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (LATEST)**: Reported untranslated text on the Galeries Photos and Aftermovies pages with screenshots. **Status: IN PROGRESS (Agent was about to fix this).**
2.  **User**: Asked why the newly created Apple reviewer account couldn't log in. **Status: RESOLVED (Agent fixed the account and verified login).**
3.  **User**: Requested UI changes for the Spotify and Social Media sections, and asked to create a backend account for Apple reviewers. **Status: RESOLVED.**
4.  **User**: Reported that despite previous fixes, there was still untranslated text, providing a screenshot of R√©seaux Sociaux. **Status: RESOLVED.**

9.  **User**: Agreed to the agent's plan to finish translations. **Status: ADDRESSED.**
10. **User**: Confirmed the agent's summary and asked to continue with the translation work. **Status: ADDRESSED.**

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The deployed TestFlight build is critically out of date and non-functional. The project's deployment pipeline (reliant on the user's local machine) is the single biggest point of failure.
-   **Mocked**: None.

-   Expo Application Services (EAS)
-   Apple Sign-In
-   Google Sign-In
-   GitHub
-   XCEED, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok (External links)

**Testing status**

-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO (Agent self-resolved issues).
-   Test files created: None.
-   Known regressions: The TestFlight app is still in a regressed state from the previous fork. No new regressions were introduced in the dev environment; in fact, a major crash was fixed.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin Email**:  / 
-   **Admin Password**: 
-   **Apple Reviewer Email**: 
-   **Apple Reviewer Password**: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
